# Home Inventory
## Background
COVID-19 and getting married have put a spotlight onto my (and my family's) personal finances. My wife an I moved for her job in 2020 and had a horrible moving experience with most of our big furniture items getting damaged. This lead me to realize that I hadn't ever reviewed our insurance to see whether it was what we actually needed, instead of what the insurance company gave us out of the box.<br/><br/>
While reviewing my insurance policy, I realized I had no idea how much coverage we actually needed. Was our current amount enough? Did we need more, less?<br/><br/>
The answer turned out to be a whole lot worse than I expected. I downloaded an app called MementoDatabase, which allows users to create a database of whatever they want. I used it to start an inventory of our personal possessions and discovered my covereage wouldn't cover even half of my possessions if they were lost to a fire or other event. That was an eye opening experience and one I found very valuable. However...<br/><br/>
MementoDatabase is too general for what I needed. I made it work, but I was never really sold on it being good for home inventories. It is difficult to see details, or find the total value, or just about anything that isn't specifically related to adding or viewing a specific entry.<br/><br/>
My final project with General Assembly is the app I wanted, not the app I had to settle for.
